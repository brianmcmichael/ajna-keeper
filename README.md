# ajna-keeper

## Purpose

A bot to automate liquidations on the Ajna platform.

## Design

- Each instance of the keeper connects to exactly one chain using a single RPC endpoint. The same keeper instance may interact with multiple pools on that chain.
- Pool addresses must be explicitly configured.
- Each instance of the keeper may unlock only a single wallet using a JSON keystore file. As such, if running multiple keepers on the same chain, different accounts should be used for each keeper to avoid nonce conflicts.
- Kick, ArbTake, Bond Colelction, Reward LP Collection - can all be enabled/disabled per pool through the provided config.

## Quick Setup

You must setup one bot per-chain, per-signer.

### Installation and Prerequisites

You'll need `node` and related tools (`npm`, `yarn`). This was developed with node v22 but should work with later versions.

Download node here: https://nodejs.org/en Downloading `node` also installs `npm`.

Install `yarn` and dependencies:

```bash
npm install --global yarn
yarn --frozen-lockfile
```

Compile to generate types using TypeChain:

```bash
yarn compile
```

### Create a new config file

Create a new `config.ts` file in the `ajna-keeper/` folder and copy the contents from `example-config.ts`.

### Get Alchemy URL with API token.

(Any RPC endpoint can be used. But, these instructions are for Alchemy.)
Go to your acount on Alchemy.
Make sure you have an app with your L2 network enabled.
Navigate to the Apps > Networks tab and copy the url under your network. It will look something like: `https://avax-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/asf...`
Replace the `ethRpcUrl` in your `config.ts` file with the url you got from alchemy.

### Get Coingecko token

Create an account on Coingecko and go to the URL https://www.coingecko.com/en/developers/dashboard
Here you will click "Add New Key" to add a new key.
In your `config.ts` file replace `coinGeckoApiKey` with the key you just created.

### Configure ajna

In `config.ts` for the section `ajna`, you will need to provide addresses for all the ajna specific contracts. These addresses can be found here: https://faqs.ajna.finance/info/deployment-addresses-and-bridges

### Configure multicall

In `config.ts` you may need to provide an address for `multicallAddress` for your specific chain. These addresses can be found here https://www.multicall3.com/deployments
If you add `multicallAddress`, then you will also need to add `multicallBlock` which is the block that multicall was added.

### Setup Ajna-Subgraph

In a different folder clone the ajna-finance repo. It is recommended that you checkout the develop branch so that you have the latests networks settings for L2s.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ajna-finance/subgraph.git
cd subgraph
git checkout develop
```

Update your `ajna-subgraph/.env` file to contain your alchemy key.

`ajna-subgraph/.env`

```.env
ETH_RPC_URL=https://avax-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/asf.....
ETH_NETWORK=avalanche:https://avax-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/asf.....
```

[Install docker](https://www.docker.com/).

Follow the setup instructions in ajna-subgraph/README.

### Setting up a keystore.

Keeper uses ethers [Encrypted JSON Wallet](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/signer/#Wallet-fromEncryptedJson), which is encrypted using a password.

The easiest way to create an encrypted JSON wallet is to use the create-keystore script provided in keeper:
Run the script with `yarn create-keystore`. Then follow the onscreen prompts.
Ensure that the generated wallet is saved in the directory specified by the `keeperKeystore` property in `config.ts`.

### Execution

```bash
yarn start --config config.ts
```

## Requirements

For each desired chain:

- A JSON-RPC endpoint is needed to query pool data and submit transactions.
- A subgraph connection is needed to iterate through buckets/borrowers/liquidations within a configured pool.
- Funds used to pay gas on that chain.
- Funds (quote token) to post liquidation bonds in each pool configured to kick.

## Features

### Kick

Starts a liquidation when a loan's threshold price exceeds the lowest utilized price in the pool by a configurable percentage.


### Take

When auction price drops a configurable percentage below a DEX price, swaps collateral for quote token using a DEX or DEX aggregator, repaying debt and earning profit for the taker.

This feature requires deploying a smart contract owned by the EOA operating the keeper.  To deploy this contract:
```
yarn compile
scripts/query-1inch.ts --config [your-configuration].ts --action deploy
```

### Arbtake

When auction price drops a configurable percentage below the highest price bucket, exchanges quote token in that bucket for collateral, earning a share of that bucket.

Note if keeper is configured to both `take` and `arbTake`, and prices are appropriate for both, the keeper will attempt to execute both strategies.  Whichever transaction is included in a block first will "win", with the other strategy potentially reverting onchain.  To conserve gas when using both, ensure one is configured at a more aggressive price than the other.

### Collect Liquidation Bond

Collects liquidation bonds (which were used to kick loans) once they are fully claimable. Note: This does not settle auctions.

### Collect Reward LP

Redeems rewarded LP for either Quote or Collateral based on config. Note: This will only collect LP rewarded while the bot is running and will not collect deposits.

## Configuration

### Configuration file

While `*.json` config files are supported, it is recommended to use `*.ts` config files so that you get the benefits of type checking.
See `example-config.ts` for reference.

### Price sources

- [coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/) - using their [simple price](https://docs.coingecko.com/v3.0.1/reference/simple-price) API
- **fixed** - hardcoded number, useful for stable pools
- **pool** - can use _lup_ or _htp_

If the price source only has quote token priced in collateral, you may add `"invert": true` to `price` config to invert the configured price.

### Dex Router

#### Configuring for 1inch

To enable 1inch swaps, you need to set up environment variables and add specific fields to config.ts.  Also be sure to set `delayBetweenActions` to 1 second or greater to avoid 1inch API rate limiting.

##### Environment Variables

Create a .env file in your project root with:

```
ONEINCH_API=https://api.1inch.dev/swap/v6.0
ONEINCH_API_KEY=[your-1inch-api-key-here]
```

A 1inch API key may be obtained from their [developer portal](https://portal.1inch.dev/).

##### Config.ts Requirements

Edit config.ts to include these fields:

`oneInchRouters`:

A dictionary of 1inch router addresses for each chain ID you want to support.

- Format: `{ [chainId]: "router-address" }`
- Example:

```
oneInchRouters: {
  1: "0x1111111254EEB25477B68fb85Ed929f73A960582",    // Ethereum Mainnet
  8453: "0x1111111254EEB25477B68fb85Ed929f73A960582", // Base
  43114: "0x1111111254EEB25477B68fb85Ed929f73A960582" // Avalanche
},
```

`tokenAddresses`:
A dictionary of token addresses for swaps (required for Avalanche, optional otherwise).

- Format: `{ [tokenName]: "token-address" }`
- Example:

```
tokenAddresses: {
  weth: "0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006", // WETH on Base
  usdc: "0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913", // USDC on Base
  avax: "0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE"  // Native AVAX
},
```

`connectorTokens` (Optional):
An array of token addresses used as intermediate connectors in 1inch swap routes. These tokens can facilitate multi-hop trades to optimize the swap path between the input and output tokens.

- Format: `Array<string>`
- Example:

```
connectorTokens: [
  "0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48", // USDC on Ethereum
  "0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F"  // DAI on Ethereum
],
```

`pools.collectLpReward.rewardAction`:
LP in buckets can be reedemed for quote token and/or collateral, depending on what the bucket holds at time of redemption. `redeemFirst` controls the redemption strategy, favoring either quote token (most situations) or collateral (useful in shorting pools). To defer redeeming the second token, it's `minAmount` can be set to a sufficiently high value that manually swapping tokens on an exchange becomes practical.

Separate reward actions may be assigned to quote token and collateral, allowing tokens to be swapped out as desired. For pools where you want to swap rewards with 1inch, set `useOneInch: true` in the `rewardAction`.

- Example: Volatile-to-volatile pool, swap both tokens for stables

```
pools: [
  {
    name: "wstETH / WETH",
    address: "0x63a366fc5976ff72999c89f69366f388b7d233e8",
    ...
    collectLpReward: {
      redeemFirst: TokenToCollect.QUOTE, // favor redeeming LP for WETH before redeeming for wstETH
      minAmountQuote: 0.001,             // don't redeem LP for dust amount of WETH
      minAmountCollateral: 0.005,        // ensure we're redeeming enough to cover swapping fees
      rewardActionQuote: {
        action: "EXCHANGE",
        address: "0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006", // Token to swap (WETH)
        targetToken: "DAI",                                    // Desired token
        slippage: 1,                                           // Slippage percentage (0-100)
        useOneInch: true                                       // Set to true for 1inch
      }
      rewardActionCollateral: {
        action: "EXCHANGE",
        address: "0xc1CBa3fCea344f92D9239c08C0568f6F2F0ee452", // Token to swap (wstETH)
        targetToken: "DAI",                                    // Desired token
        slippage: 1,                                           // Slippage percentage (0-100)
        useOneInch: true                                       // Set to true for 1inch
      },
    },
  }
],
```

- Example: Stablecoin pool, swap collateral for quote token

```
pools: [
  {
      name: 'savUSD / USDC',
      address: '0x936e0fdec18d4dc5055b3e091fa063bc75d6215c',
      ...
      collectLpReward: {
        redeemFirst: TokenToCollect.QUOTE,
        minAmountQuote: 0.01,       // don't redeem LP for less than a penny
        minAmountCollateral: 0.05,  // don't redeem LP for less than what it may cost to swap collateral for USDC
        rewardActionCollateral: {
          action: RewardActionLabel.EXCHANGE,
          address: "0x06d47F3fb376649c3A9Dafe069B3D6E35572219E", // Token to swap (savUSD)
          targetToken: "usdc",                                   // Target token (USDC)
          slippage: 1,                                           // Slippage percentage (0-100)
          useOneInch: true                                       // Set to true for 1inch
        },
      },
  }
],
```

- Example: Shorting pool, no automated swapping

```
pools: [
  {
    name: "DAI / wSOL",
    address: "0x63a366fc5976ff72999c89f69366f388b7d233e8",
    ...
    collectLpReward: {
      redeemFirst: TokenToCollect.COLLATERAL, // favor redeeming LP for DAI
      minAmountQuote: 200,                    // don't exchange LP for an amount of wSOL not worth manually swapping
      minAmountCollateral: 0.15,              // don't redeem LP for less than transaction fees
    },
  }
],

```

##### Notes

- If `useOneInch` is `true` but `oneInchRouters` is missing a `chainId`, the script will fail.
- Ensure the `.env` file is loaded (via `dotenv/config`) in your project.

#### Configuring for Uniswap V3

To enable Uniswap V3 swaps, you need fewer settings in config.ts. No .env file is required.

##### Config.ts Requirements

Edit `config.ts` to include these optional fields:

`uniswapOverrides` (Optional):
Customize Uniswap V3 settings. If not provided, it defaults to WETH swaps.

- Format:

```
uniswapOverrides: {
  wethAddress: "weth-contract-address",
  uniswapV3Router: "uniswap-v3-router-address"
}
```

- Example:

```
uniswapOverrides: {
  wethAddress: "0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2", // WETH on Ethereum
  uniswapV3Router: "0xE592427A0AEce92De3Edee1F18E0157C05861564" // Uniswap V3 Router
},
```

`tokenAddresses` (Optional):
Useful for specifying target tokens (e.g., WETH) if not using `uniswapOverrides`.

- Example:

```
tokenAddresses: {
  weth: "0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2", // WETH on Ethereum
  usdc: "0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48"  // USDC on Ethereum
},
```

`pools.collectLpReward.rewardAction`:
For pools where you want to swap rewards with Uniswap V3, set `useOneInch: false` and optionally add a `fee`.

- Format:

```
{
  name: "Your Pool Name",
  address: "0xpoolAddress",
  // Other pool settings...
  collectLpReward: {
    redeemFirst: "QUOTE", // or "COLLATERAL"
    minAmount: 0.001,
    rewardAction: {
      action: "EXCHANGE",
      address: "0xtokenAddress", // Token to swap
      targetToken: "weth",      // Target token (e.g., "weth", "usdc")
      slippage: 1,             // Slippage (ignored for Uniswap)
      useOneInch: false,       // Set to false for Uniswap
      fee: 3000               // Fee tier (500, 3000, 10000)
    }
  }
}
```

- Example:

```
pools: [
  {
    name: "WETH / USDC",
    address: "0x0b17159f2486f669a1f930926638008e2ccb4287",
    collectLpReward: {
      redeemFirst: "COLLATERAL",
      minAmount: 0.001,
      rewardAction: {
        action: "EXCHANGE",
        address: "0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2",
        targetToken: "usdc",
        slippage: 1,
        useOneInch: false,
        fee: 3000 // 0.3% fee tier
      }
    }
  }
],
```

##### Notes

- `fee` is the Uniswap V3 pool fee tier (e.g., `500` for 0.05%, `3000` for 0.3%, `10000` for 1%).
- slippage is ignored for Uniswap swaps.
- If `targetToken` isn’t WETH, ensure it matches `uniswapOverrides.wethAddress` or adjust the underlying logic.

## Testing

Follow instructions for [Installation and Prequisites](#installation-and-prerequisites).
Then [get your alchemy API token](#installation-and-prerequisites) and [your Goingecko API token](#installation-and-prerequisites).

### Add Alchemy API key and Coingecko API to .env

Add your alchemy API key and coingecko API key to .env

```.env
ALCHEMY_API_KEY="<api_key>"
COINGECKO_API_KEY="<api_key>"
```

Note: You will need to enable mainnet in Alchemy since hardhat queries from mainnet.

### Running tests

#### Unit tests
```bash
yarn unit-tests
```

#### Integration tests

In one terminal run:

```bash
npx hardhat node
```

In a second terminal run:

```bash
yarn integration-tests
```
